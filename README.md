# decimal-thingie
Interactive visualization about how to find the decimal expansion of a rational number.

This was my first Javascript project.  It got a bit messy toward the end, but I decided to start a new project with what I had learned instead of spending my limited free time cleaning it up.

The drawing functionality is getting spun off into its own thing but not while I'm still in school.
