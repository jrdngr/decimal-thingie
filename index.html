				<p>This is a little toy to help you understand how decimal notation works.</p>
				<p>We divide the number line up into 10 closed intervals and give each of them a label.  A closed interval is just a set of numbers
				between two points where both of the endpoints are included.  For example, the interval labeled 5 includes all of the points between 5/10 and 6/10, as well as 5/10 and 6/10 themselves.</p>
				<p>The red line represents the number for which we're trying to find a decimal.  For each digit, we simply look at which interval contains our number and add its label to our decimal.
					Then we zoom in on that interval and repeat the process.</p>
				<p>Since we're using closed intervals, each interval shares its endpoints with its neighbors.  This means that it's possible for our number to be in two different intervals at once.  As a result,
					some numbers have two different decimal representations.  Can you figure out which numbers have two decimal representations in general?</p>
